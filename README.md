## Presentation
This GitHub repository contains all the elements to deploy the [SportsBetPy](https://github.com/MathieuCrosnier/SportsBetPy) project developed in the framework of the DataScientest training.
SportsBetPy is an application that allows a bettor to compute the odds of a football game, with an objective to help him identify the profitable bets by comparing the computed odds with the bookmakers odds.

## Main features
### REST API
The main feature is an API developed with FastAPI.
The API allows to perform 8 different requests :

- /signup

This endpoint allows to create an account by typing a username and a password. The new user is created with standard rights. Users are stored in a SQL table called [users](#users).
Nota: A user with username "Mathieu" and password "Crosnier" and with administrator rights exists by default.

- /token

When you log in to the API, this endpoint generates a JWT token. It allows to safely  identify who got connected and to keep this information until the token expires.

- /user

This endpoint displays, for the logged in user, it's username and rights.

- /prediction

This endpoint allows to make a prediction using the Machine Learning model. The user must type in the 2 teams playing the game and the game date (with yyyy-mm-dd format). The result is the computed odds. It allows to compare to the bookmakers odds and decide whether or not a bet is profitable. For more information on the theory behind odds, please refer to the following [report](https://github.com/MathieuCrosnier/SportsBetPy/blob/main/SportsBetPy.pdf).
Predictions are stored in a SQL table called [predictions](#predictions).

- /initialize_tables_matchesresults_and_fifa

This endpoint allows to reset both tables [matches_results](#matches_results) and [FIFA](#fifa).
